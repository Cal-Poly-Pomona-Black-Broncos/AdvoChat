# Project Focus: Enhanced Access through Telehealth

AdvoChat is an innovative AI-powered chatbot designed to improve healthcare access and navigation for Black patients, addressing systemic disparities in the healthcare system. By leveraging advanced technology and data-driven insights, AdvoChat empowers patients to overcome barriers such as health literacy gaps and accessibility.

# Objective
To enhance healthcare access for underserved Black communities by providing personalized, AI-driven support tailored to individual needs.

# How AdvoChat Works:

Streamlined Data Collection:
AdvoChat begins by collecting essential user information through an intuitive online form (e.g., Google Forms). This form captures personal and demographic details, medical history and chronic conditions, and healthcare preferences, such as insurance type and preferred distance to providers.

Personalized Hospital Matching:
AdvoChat analyzes the user’s input and matches them with suitable hospitals or clinics within their specified travel radius. The matching process accounts for medical history compatibility with the hospital's specialties, insurance provider acceptance, proximity to the user’s location.

AI-Powered Conversational Assistance:
AdvoChat offers real-time, personalized guidance through its conversational assistant. This feature helps users address specific healthcare concerns, understand treatment options and terminology by answering questions with clarity.
